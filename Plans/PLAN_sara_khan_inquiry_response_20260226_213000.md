# Plan: Respond to Sara Khan's AI Automation Inquiry

**Contact:** Sara Khan — Operations Manager, TechStartup.io
**Email:** sara.khan@techstartup.io
**Received:** 2026-02-26 09:00:00
**Priority:** 🟡 Medium (inbound inquiry — matches keyword: "question")

---

## Context

Sara Khan from TechStartup.io (12-person SaaS company, Karachi) has reached out asking about AI automation services. She needs three things:

1. An overview of services offered
2. Rough pricing / engagement model
3. A time for a 20-minute intro call next week

This is a **warm inbound sales lead** — her pain points (email triage, scheduling, status reports, LinkedIn posting) directly match our service offering.
