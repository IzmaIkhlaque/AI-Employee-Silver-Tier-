Hi Sara,

Thank you for reaching out — it's great to hear from you! The challenges you've described — sorting emails, scheduling follow-ups, writing status reports, and posting on LinkedIn — are exactly the kinds of tasks we help teams like yours automate.

Here's what you asked for:

---

**1. What We Do**

We build custom AI automation systems that take over repetitive back-office and communication work. For a team your size, that typically looks like:

- **Email triage & drafting** — incoming emails sorted by priority, routine replies drafted for your review
- **Follow-up scheduling** — automated reminders and calendar coordination so nothing slips through
- **Weekly report generation** — status reports compiled automatically, ready for your sign-off
- **LinkedIn content drafting** — posts drafted and queued for approval before anything goes live

Everything is built with a **human-in-the-loop** approach — the AI handles the heavy lifting, and your team approves before anything is sent, posted, or actioned. You stay in control.

**2. Engagement Model & Rough Pricing**

We start every engagement with a free discovery call to understand your workflow. From there, we typically propose one of three paths:

| Tier | What's Included | Best For |
|------|----------------|----------|
| **Starter** | 1–2 automations set up and running | Teams piloting AI for the first time |
| **Growth** | 3–5 automations + 30 days of support | Teams ready to automate core operations |
| **Custom** | Fully tailored system, ongoing retainer | Larger or more complex needs |

Pricing is project-based. We'll share specific numbers after our call once we understand your setup — we don't believe in one-size-fits-all quotes.

**3. Intro Call — Next Week**

I'd love to schedule that 20-minute call! Here are a few options for next week:

- **Monday, March 2** — 10:00 AM or 2:00 PM (PKT)
- **Tuesday, March 3** — 11:00 AM or 3:00 PM (PKT)
- **Wednesday, March 4** — 10:00 AM or 4:00 PM (PKT)

Just reply with what works best for you, or suggest another time — I'm flexible.

Looking forward to connecting, Sara!
